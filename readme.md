# 🥦 Grocery Product Recognition & Recipe Recommendation

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to build a system that can **recognize grocery products** from images (e.g., photos of a shopping bag, fridge, or pantry) and provide **smart recipe recommendations**.

The system goes beyond simple recognition — it can also **detect spoiled or expired products** and exclude them from suggestions. All valid items are added to a **virtual basket**, which serves as the basis for personalized recipe recommendations.

Additionally, if a recipe requires extra ingredients, the system can **suggest complementary products** to help users prepare complete meals.

## ✨ Features

- 🛒 **Grocery Recognition** – Detect and classify food products from photos.
- ❌ **Spoilage Detection** – Identify spoiled or expired items and remove them from the basket.
- 🧺 **Virtual Basket** – Store recognized products for recipe generation.
- 🍳 **Recipe Recommendation** – Suggest recipes that match available products.
- ➕ **Complementary Suggestions** – Recommend missing ingredients to complete a recipe.

## 💡 Use Cases

- ♻️ Reduce **food waste** by suggesting meals with soon-to-expire products.
- 🍲 Help users discover **new recipes** from everyday groceries.
- 🛍️ Make grocery shopping smarter by showing what else to buy for a chosen meal.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Computer Vision:** Object detection + classification models (e.g., YOLO, EfficientNet, ResNet).
- **Spoilage Detection:** Image quality analysis + freshness classification.
- **Recipe Recommendation:** NLP-based recommendation system with product-to-recipe matching.
- **Backend:** FastAPI / Flask for serving models.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for product and recipe storage.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- 📱 Mobile app integration (scan fridge/bag in real-time).
- 🌍 Multilingual recipe recommendations.
- 🧠 Personalized suggestions based on dietary preferences and history.
